ggv() will generate map for random ggv snp or as table (see ?ggv)
testSNPs will bring up 2 ggv SNPs (1 hgdp and 1 1kgenome)
testVCF("rs1834640") will look up imputed hgdp data or give chr and pos
testVCF will load XML metadata for populations and samples

Read plink files?
Cannot convert cluster maps to pdf. Are tile maps SGV? What not to do?
For SNP rs1834640 ancestral and derived are reversed in ggv and testVCF. I believe I still need to look up EPO ancestral states for build hg19

GGV HGDP: Build hg18
GGV 1kGenomes: Build hg19
GGV popres:Build hg18

Imputed HGDP: Build hg19
